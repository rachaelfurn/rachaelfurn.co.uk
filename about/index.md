# About Me

I'm Rachael and I like to create things.

This site is a huge mix of everything that I create, from generative art to tutorials on braiding hair, as well as origami, vegan recipes, and guides on digital accessibility. Currently I'm learning to draw for the first time and learning German for the second time. 

In the spirit of 'about' pages from the olden days, my likes and dislikes are as follows:

### Likes

* Motorsport
* Early 2000s North American Pop Punk music
* Walking in the woods with my dog

### Dislikes

* Football
* Spiders
* People who abandon their trollies in supermarket car parks

## Contact Me

I don't have a contact form on my site, or the ability to comment on my blog posts, but you can send me an email at rachael@rachaelfurn.co.uk or message me on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rachaelfurn/). I'd love to hear from you.


## About the Site

This site is all static files, built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I use the [11ty Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) template to get started, and have made minor customisations to it since. Doing it this way rather than using a more traditional CMS like [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) means that my site is super fast (because it's just static files), can't be hacked (because there's no database driving it) and can be hosted for free (which means I won't need to feel guilty if I don't add a new blog post every week.)
